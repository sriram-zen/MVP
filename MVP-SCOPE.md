# MVP SCOPE
## Feature: Secure, Well-Documented REST APIs for Core Modules

### Description 

 All platform modules (data migration, donation, WhatsApp, analytics) must expose secure REST APIs with documentation, access controls, and version management for internal and third-party integrations.

 ###Scope 

 Design and publish RESTful APIs for all major modules, with versioned endpoint URLs and OpenAPI/Swagger documentation. Enforce strong authentication and authorization on all endpoints. Support integration with third-party services (e.g., payment gateways, WhatsApp, analytics) using secure API keys or OAuth. API access to sensitive data must be restricted based on user roles. All API requests must be authenticated and authorized.
